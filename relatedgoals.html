            <p>It's past time to reconsider how we produce, distribute, and consume food. Agriculture, forestry, and fisheries, when done correctly, can offer nutritious food for all while also supporting people-centered rural development and environmental protection.<p>
      <p>Soils, waterways, oceans, forests, and biodiversity are all being degraded at an alarming rate right now. Climate change is putting even more strain on the resources we rely on, raising the probability of disasters like drought and flooding. Many rural women and men are unable to make ends meet on their farm, prompting them to seek employment in cities. Millions of children are stunted, or too short for their age, as a result of severe malnutrition caused by a lack of food security.</p>
      <p>If we are to feed the 815 million people who are hungry today and the extra 2 billion people who are predicted to be undernourished by 2050, we will require a significant overhaul in the global food and agriculture system. Agriculture investments are critical for boosting agricultural productivity, and sustainable food production systems are required to help lessen the dangers of hunger.</p>

            <p>Clean, readily available water for all is a crucial component of the world we want to live in, and there is enough fresh water on the earth to meet this need. Millions of people, including children, die each year as a result of diseases linked to insufficient water supply, sanitation, and hygiene owing to bad economics or poor infrastructure.</p>
          <p>Water scarcity, poor water quality, and inadequate sanitation have a severe influence on poor families' food security, livelihood options, and educational possibilities around the world. At this time, more than 2 billion people are at risk of losing access to freshwater resources, and by 2050, at least one out of every four people will be living in a country with chronic or recurring water shortages. Drought affects some of the world's poorest countries, causing hunger and malnutrition to worsen. Fortunately, significant progress has been made in the last decade in terms of drinking water and sanitation, with over 90% of the world's population now having access to better drinking water sources.Increased investment in local management of freshwater ecosystems and sanitation infrastructure is needed to enhance sanitation and access to drinking water in various developing nations in Sub-Saharan Africa, Central Asia, Southern Asia, Eastern Asia, and South-Eastern Asia.</p>

            <p>The temperature, chemistry, currents, and life of the world's seas drive global processes that keep the Earth habitable for humans. The sea provides and regulates our precipitation, drinking water, weather, climate, coastlines, much of our food, and even the oxygen in the air we breathe. Oceans and seas have always been important commercial and transit routes throughout history.</p>
          <p>A sustainable future necessitates careful management of this vital global resource. However, pollution is causing a constant deterioration of coastal waterways, and ocean acidification is having a negative impact on ecosystems and biodiversity. Small-scale fisheries are also suffering as a result of this.</p>
          <p> prevent overfishing, marine pollution, and ocean acidification, marine protected zones must be actively administered and well-resourced, and laws must be put in place.</p>
