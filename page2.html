		<p id="content">Forests are crucial to global sustainable development, affecting both the natural environment and economic prosperity. They are home to 80% of the world terrestrial specific, provide clean water, prevent soil erosion and flood, and can provide one third of carbon mitigation efforts needs to hold temperature rise below 2<sup>o</sup>C. Some 1.6 billion people depend on forests for sustenance, duel and medicinal plants, while 10 million people are employed in the forestry sector worldwide. 
		 Environmental conservation has an impact on every level of life on the planet, from human beings to animals and plants.<br> <br> 

Because of this, it’s an essential part of sustainable development, which is why GVI makes marine and wildlife conservation a key focus in all our programs.<br> <br> 

Safeguarding the world’s forests can assist in addressing climate change and slow the extinction rate of a whole host of plant and animal species. It also promotes the welfare of human beings in myriad ways.<br>  <br> 

Currently, forest resources provide around two billion people with their livelihoods by generating food and income. But, when these resources aren’t used in a sustainable way, they deplete faster than they can be restored, thus reducing the access that future generations have to these resources.<br><br>   

Today, deforestation is happening at a rapid rate. Around ten million hectares of forest area are lost each year. This is one way environmental degradation significantly impacts global development.<br> <br>

Adding to the conservation of forests and wildlife can also contribute to the economic development of communities around the world, and improve the quality of life for the global community.<br><br>  

GVI incorporates wildlife conservation into targeted volunteer programs. By getting involved in a wildlife conservation volunteer program, you’ll be adding to UN SDG 15: Life on Land – as well as the 16 other UN SDGs – and be part of global conservation efforts.<br> <br>
